# Introduction

This vignette provides an overview of the `process_csv` function, which 
is designed to import and preprocess financial transaction data from a CSV file. 
This function handles tasks such as reading data, cleaning, and renaming columns, 
making it easier for you to analyze your financial data.

# Prerequisites

Load the required packages:

```{r setup}
library(RSQLite)
library(tidyverse)
# library(cashier)
devtools::load_all()
```

```{r}
ledger <- Ledger$new(":memory:")
ledger$postings$data
```

# Import Overview

The `process_posting_csv` function performs the following tasks:

1. Imports Data: Reads financial transactions (postings) from a CSV file.
2. Handles Locale Settings: Converts date formats, decimal separators, and column types based on locale.
3. Renames Columns: Renames columns to shorter, more intuitive names.
4. Prepares Data: Ensures the data is ready for further analysis.

# Arguments

- `file_path`: The file path to the CSV file containing your transaction data. 
This file should be formatted with `;` as a separator, `,` as a decimal mark, 
and dates in `dd.mm.yyyy` format.

# Details

The `process_posting_csv` function reads a CSV file containing financial transactions and performs several key operations to ensure the data is in a usable format. Specifically:

- Locale Handling: Since the CSV uses a comma as a decimal mark and a period as a grouping mark, the locale() function is used to correctly interpret these values during import.
- Column Renaming: After loading the data, the columns are renamed to shorter, more descriptive names to make further analysis easier.
- Date Parsing: Dates are automatically parsed into Date objects.

# Example Usage

Suppose you have a CSV file named `sample_transactions.csv`. You can process this file as follows:

```{r example usage}
# Path to your CSV file
file_path <- "../inst/extdata/sample_transactions.csv"

# Process the postings
postings <- process_posting_csv(file_path)

# View the first few rows of the processed data
head(postings)
```

```{r}
ledger$import_postings(postings)
ledger$postings$data
ledger$get_transactions()
ledger$import_postings(postings)
ledger$postings$data
ledger$get_transactions()

transactions <- ledger$get_transactions()
save(transactions, file = "../data/sample_transactions.rda")
```
