\description{
This function reads financial transaction data from a CSV file, processes it, and returns a clean data frame. The CSV file is expected to use `;` as a separator, `,` as a decimal mark, and dates in `dd.mm.yyyy` format. The function renames columns to shorter, intuitive names, and converts dates and amounts into appropriate formats.
}
\details{
The function automatically handles locale-specific settings, such as decimal marks and date formats, using the `readr` and `dplyr` packages. It expects specific columns in the CSV file and will only import those relevant to transaction processing.

# Assuming you have a CSV file named "transactions.csv"
