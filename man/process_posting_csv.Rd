\title{Process Financial Transactions from CSV File}
\usage{
process_posting_csv(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A string specifying the file path to the CSV file containing the transaction data.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{account_iban}: The user's IBAN.
  \item \code{booking_date}: The transaction booking date (as a Date object).
  \item \code{value_date}: The date the transaction is effective (as a Date object).
  \item \code{payee_name}: The name of the counterparty.
  \item \code{payee_iban}: The counterparty's IBAN.
  \item \code{description}: The purpose of the transaction (e.g., Rent payment, Groceries).

}
}
\description{
This function reads financial transaction data from a CSV file, processes it, and returns a clean data frame. The CSV file is expected to use `;` as a separator, `,` as a decimal mark, and dates in `dd.mm.yyyy` format. The function renames columns to shorter, intuitive names, and converts dates and amounts into appropriate formats.
}
\details{
The function automatically handles locale-specific settings, such as decimal marks and date formats, using the `readr` and `dplyr` packages. It expects specific columns in the CSV file and will only import those relevant to transaction processing.

\dontrun{
# Assuming you have a CSV file named "transactions.csv"
file_path <- "path/to/transactions.csv"
transactions <- process_csv(file_path)
head(transactions)
