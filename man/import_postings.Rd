\title{Import Postings into Ledger}
\usage{
import_postings(postings, ledger)
}
\arguments{
\item{postings}{A tibble containing processed postings data from the CSV file.}

\item{ledger}{A list representing the ledger system, containing the `accounts` and `postings` tables.}
}
\description{
Imports postings from a processed CSV file into the ledger system.
The function updates or appends account and posting information in the ledger.
}
\details{
The function selects relevant columns from the postings data, extracts account information,
and either adds a new account or updates an existing account in the ledger. It then appends
the postings data to the `postings` table in the ledger.

- If the account does not exist in the ledger, it is added as a new entry.
- If the account exists but has an earlier opening date, the existing account is updated.
- The postings are appended to the ledger's `postings` table.
- Missing values in character columns are replaced with empty strings.
