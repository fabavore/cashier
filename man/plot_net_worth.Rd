  \item \code{date}: The date of each net worth calculation (as a Date object).
  \item \code{net_worth}: The cumulative net worth at each date.
}}
}
\value{
A `plotly` object representing the combined net worth line chart, with both daily and monthly data.
}
\description{
This function creates a combined line chart of net worth over time, showing both daily net worth and monthly aggregated net worth. The chart is created using the `plotly` package, with separate traces for daily and monthly data.

net_worth <- data.frame(
  date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2024-01-01"), to = as.Date("2024-12-31"), by = "day"),
  net_worth = cumsum(rnorm(365, mean = 0, sd = 100))
