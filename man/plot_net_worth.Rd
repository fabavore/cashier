\usage{
plot_net_worth(transactions)
}
\arguments{
\item{transactions}{A data frame or tibble containing transaction data. The data frame must include at least the following columns:
- `account_name`: Character, the name of the account.
- `booking_date`: Date, the date the transaction was booked.
- `balance`: Numeric, the balance of the account at the time of the transaction.}
}
\value{
A `plotly` plot object that displays the balances of individual accounts as well as the total net worth over time.
}
\description{
This function creates a `plotly` line plot that visualizes the net worth over time for multiple accounts. It handles missing balances by filling them down and calculating the total net worth by summing balances across accounts.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
transactions <- data.frame(
  account_name = rep(c("Account A", "Account B"), each = 10),
  booking_date = rep(seq.Date(as.Date("2023-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 10), 2),
  balance = c(1000, 1050, 1100, 1200, 1250, 1300, 1400, 1450, 1500, 1600,
              500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950)
